Cardiovascular Disease PredictionA machine learning application designed to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) based on a patient's health metrics. It features a comprehensive data analysis pipeline and a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) for making real-time predictions.🚀 FeaturesData Analysis & Pre-processing: Cleans and prepares the cardiovascular disease dataset, handling outliers and duplicates.Model Training: Trains a Random Forest Classifier on the processed data to predict CVD risk.Interactive UI: A simple and intuitive graphical interface built with Tkinter to input patient data and get instant risk predictions.Saved Model: The trained model and data scaler are saved, so the analysis script only needs to be run once.🛠️ Technologies UsedPython – Core programming languagePandas – Data manipulation and analysisScikit-learn – Machine learning model training, pre-processing, and evaluationMatplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualizationTkinter – Graphical user interfaceJoblib – Saving and loading trained models⚙️ Getting StartedFollow these steps to set up and run the application on your local machine.1. PrerequisitesEnsure you have Python installed. Then install the necessary libraries:pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn joblib
2. Train the ModelBefore using the prediction app, run the analysis script to train the model and generate the required files. Make sure you have the cardio_train.csv file in your project directory.python cardio_analysis.py
This will create the following files in your project directory:heart_disease_model.pkl – The trained machine learning modelheart_disease_scaler.pkl – The saved scaler for pre-processing3. Run the Prediction AppLaunch the user interface:python cardio4.py
The "Cardiovascular Disease Prediction" window will appear. Enter the patient's data and click the Predict button to see the result.📁 Project Structure.
